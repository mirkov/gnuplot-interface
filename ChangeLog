	* README.org: Updated documentation to the new structure-based
	user-setup.

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (default-terminal): New function with
	error checking.
	(start-gnuplot): Added code-block for CCL
	(:default-terminal executable-path): Modified to query the
	structure defined in user-setup.  The user interface can still be
	improved.

2014-10-04  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (executable-path): New function with some
	error checking to flag some errors if the path is not properly
	defined.

2013-01-31  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* examples.lisp: Updated and cleaned up examples

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (echo-command, gnuplot-echo-command
	*command-copy*): Removed these commands and special variable.
	Command echoing is now handled with the
	with-captured-gnuplot-input macro
	(with-captured-gnuplot-input): New macro that replaces the
	functionality of echo commands


	* gnuplot-interface.asd (#:gnuplot-interface): Removed
	"gnuplot-interface" from the components list.  The streams in that
	file are out of date

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (command): Enabled
	`get-output-stream-string' to clear the echo buffer.  This buffer
	would overflow after plotting large data sets.  I may want to
	reconsider stream architecture.  Maybe I should disable the echo,
	and enable it only when required.

2013-01-11  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (send-line): Modified to only send line,
	without flushing output.  Flushing output is done with
	`finish-command'
	(finish-command): New function

2013-01-06  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (gnuplot-for-windows-p)
	(filename-normalizer): Functions for normalizing pathnames for
	underlying OS

2012-11-21  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (start-gnuplot): Fixed bug in sbcl.  Now
	calling *executable*
	(*executable*): Added darwin option for macports

2012-11-20  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface-package-def.lisp (#:gnuplot-interface):
	Removed use of EXTERNAL-PROGRAM, as it currently does not work

	* gnuplot-interface.asd (#:gnuplot-interface): Removed dependency
	on EXTERNAL-PROGRAM, as it currently does not work

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (*native-external-program*): New variable
	controls compilation of START-GNUPLOT
	(start-gnuplot): Cleaned up code, documentation, and code comments.

2012-11-07  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface-package-def.lisp: Pushing
	:native-external-program to *features*

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (start-gnuplot): Changed :ouput from t to
	:stream for SBCL native command.
	(start-gnuplot): Fixed a closing parethesis error on clisp &
	cygwin & native-external-program feature selector
	(stop-gnuplot): Wrapped cleanup code inside unwind-protect.  Not
	quite sure that it is working though

2012-11-06  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (start-gnuplot): Added feature
	`native-external-program' to enable testing of external program
	invocation

2012-10-27  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp: Renamed variables *input* and *output*
	into more descriptive *gnuplot-input* and *gnuplot-output*
	(start-gnuplot): I now use external-program:run to start gnuplot
	-- I had to modify that routine because it was signaling an error,
	and I notified the maintainer.  I kept the old code for clisp for
	just in case.
	Changed all defvar to defparameter for easier maintenance.

2012-06-21  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (*executable*, *terminal*): The tests
	were not well defined on clisp+cygwin.  I had to redefine unix to
	exclude clisp & wgnuplot.  This needs more attention.

2012-05-31  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp: Porting code to desktop.  Because of
	outdated github the code may be slightly unstable.  Needs to be
	retested on sbcl and laptop.
	(start-gnuplot): While porting to new desktop (where it now
	works), I might have mungled the interface.  This functions needs
	to be retested on SBCL and on my laptop.
	(init-gnuplot): Fixed bug - I was using symbolicate, which I don't
	think was necessary.  Now I downcase the terminal name, since that
	seems to be the convention on gnuplot.
	(*executable*): Modified sbcl search path to test both
	/usr/local/bin and /usr/bin
	(*terminal*): Added case for unix feature setting to X11.
	(start-gnuplot): I restored the sbcl specific code since
	exteranl-program:run did not work
	(*executable*): Changed sbcl feature filter to unix feature
	filter.  That should make it more robust

2012-02-28  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface-package-def.lisp (#:gnuplot-interface):
	Exporting the *terminal* symbol

2012-02-27  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (stop): Added as alias to stop-gnuplot

	* gnuplot-interface-package-def.lisp (#:gnuplot-interface): Added
	:start and :stop as exported symbols

2012-02-26  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (start-gnuplot): Set return value to
	(values)
	(start-gnuplot): Implemented call to gnuplot via
	external-program:run.  Tested on clisp only

2012-02-25  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp (*executable*): Added wgnuplot path
	(*terminal*): Changed feature tests to be based on platforms, not
	my individual machines
	(eval-when (...)): cleaned-up DISPLAY initialization 
	(command): cleaned-up accumulated crud
	(gnuplot-command): args is now a &rest, and we use apply instead
	of funcall

2011-10-05  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* package.lisp (#:gnuplot-interface): Updated documentation

	* gnuplot-interface.lisp: I replaced the symbol macros for the
	utility functions by function calls
